A classification model to predict whether price range of mobile based on certain specifications

Problem statement: 
Create a classification model to predict whether price range of mobile based on certain specifications

Context: 
An entrepreneur has started his own mobile company. He wants to give
tough fight to big companies like Apple, Samsung etc.
He does not know how to estimate price of mobiles his company creates. In this
competitive mobile phone market, one cannot simply assume things. To solve this
problem, he collects sales data of mobile phones of various companies.
He wants to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone (e.g., RAM,
Internal Memory etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning.
So, he needs your help to solve this problem.
In this problem you do not have to predict actual price but a price range indicating
how high the price is
